GAME STORY:
	
	You are one of the investors in Berlin ferociously raising the rents. 	
	Your goal is simple: Make more and more capitals by investing to the realestates by competing against other investors. 
	There is no complicated contracts or paperworks in this game, you simply need to throw your capital at the buildings!

	An ironic, but funny way of portraying the current gentrification in Berlin is challenged in this game.
